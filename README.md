# Personal Website project
+ Project scaffolded using Vue 3 + Vite and bun
+ Quick styling using tailwindcss

A nice way to get to know vue.

## Project Structure
The `src` folder structure is organized as per my preference:
- `assets/` — Static assets such as images, fonts, and icons.
- `components/` — Reusable Vue components used throughout the application. (will maybe change to feature folders/component islands if the project grows #doubt)
- `styles/` — Global CSS configuration files.
- `utils/` — Utility functions and helper modules.
- `App.vue` — Root Vue component.
- `main.ts` — Application entry point, bootstraps the Vue app.
  > Is this really needed? It feels redundant.

This structure helps keep the codebase organized and maintainable as the project grows.
